# Stabilizer Spring Mount
Replicate the component tape stabilizer spring mount, while dropping the height and changing the horizontal center point.

This was created out of a need to be able to feed a 32mm tape with a 8mm deep pocket, without scraping across the original spring mount.

I believe this would be applicable to all feeder sizes > 32mm, but have not tried it.

The dimensional values are tuned for PLA FDM without scaling the STL.
